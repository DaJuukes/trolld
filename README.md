# trolld
A package that randomly "throws" fake errors that look very scary. If used discreetly it could make for a very fun afternoon of watching your co-worker panic!

# How to use
Simple require the package as a function (preferably discreetly somehow):

`require('trolld')([chance])` - Replace [chance] with a 0-100 chance to trigger on load. If not provided, one will be provided.
