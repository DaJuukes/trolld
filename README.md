# trolld
A package that uses cryptographically-secure randomness to very rarely throw fake errors. Very discreet and could make for a very fun afternoon watching your co-worker!

# How to use
Simple require the package as a function (preferably discreetly somehow):

`require('trolld')([chance])` - Replace [chance] with a 0-100 chance to trigger on load. If not provided, one will be provided.
